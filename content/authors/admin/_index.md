Hi! I am currently a postdoc at Cornell University, working with Prof. Ziv Goldfeld and Prof. Christina Lee Yu. I am honored to be funded by [Center for Applied Mathematics](https://www.cam.cornell.edu/cam) postdoc program at Cornell. My current research interests lie in the intersection of information theory and machine learning.
